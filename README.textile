h1. Sounder

Apache Pig examples galore!

Sounder is a grouping of examples and pig udfs for Apache "Pig":http://hadoop.apache.org/pig, the query language for Hadoop. 

Here you'll find some examples for expressing all those simple (and some not so simple) things in Pig Latin.

Examples include:

* Normalizing a numeric column by its maximum
* Extracting symmetric links in a network graph
* Iteratively calculating pagerank (no java here folks...)
* Other graph processing algorithms (degree distribution, truss extraction, etc)
* Finding the nearest neighbors of geo points
* And many more...

h2. Why is it called Sounder?

Evidently, a grouping of pigs is called a sounder so...
