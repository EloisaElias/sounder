h1. Nearest Neighbors

Uses a couple pig udfs and a jruby run script to find the nearest
neighbors of points in geonames.

h2. And we're off like a herd of turtles...

h3. Get the data

Download the data from geonames. It's reasonably large so give it a few
minutes.

<pre><code>
$: wget http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/allCountries.zip
</code></pre>

and unzip it

<pre><code>
$: unzip allCountries.zip
</code></pre>

h3. Build the udfs

<pre><code>
$: cd sounder/udf
$: mvn package
</code></pre>

h3. To Hdfs with it

Put the data on the hdfs so we can process it

<pre><code>
$: hadoop fs -put allCountries.txt .
</code></pre>

h3. Run the algorithm

Choose a K (the number of neighbors to find for each point) and run it!

<pre><code>
$: cd sounder/scripts/analysis/geo/nearestneighbors
$: ./nearest_neigbhors.rb allCountries.txt <K>
</code></pre>


h2. Caveats

* This is meant to be an example only. Don't get cranky if not
  everything is smooth and configurable.
* You'll have to have jruby installed
* nearest_neighbors.rb assumes you have cloudera's
  version of pig 0.8.1 installed in the location
  the debian installer would put it "/usr/lib/pig/pig-0.8.1-cdh3u1-core.jar"

  You might consider changing it...
